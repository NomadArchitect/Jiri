      "message": "This is a nice approach! I think it may not be obvious why this particular approach is taken. Can you expand the comment to mention that this reverse-matching approach is intended to allow hierarchical matching for hostnames?\n\nOften when this is done, it\u0027s also desirable to have some form of explicit wildcarding support for the \"reference\" domain. For example, \"*.google.com\" or \".google.com\" might be inputs that would support matching \"foo.google.com\", whereas \"google.com\" might be stricter in that it would _only_ match \"google.com\". Do you think this sort of thing would be useful for the expected use-case here?",

      "message": "For restricting the hostname for fuchsia code base, I think wildcard support might be unnecessary as we just want to whitelist very few secend level domains like googlesource.com . It would be useful if we want to reuse this function for other purposes. \n\nI have included a wildcard version of this function using greedy approach. In worst case it would require O(n^2) instead of O(n) of current suffix matching. Consider the length of urls in Fuchsia, it\u0027s probably not a big deal. Please let me know what\u0027s your preference. I will delete the other one.",
