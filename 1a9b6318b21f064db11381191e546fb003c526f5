      "message": "This behavior is a bit concerning to me.\n\nIf I\u0027m trying to patch with -topic -cherry-pick flags and seeing an error in the middle, I would most likely just want to abort the whole patching process, resolve the issues (e.g. stash some local changes and/or jiri update), and then try jiri patch the whole topic again.\n\nIf I\u0027m seeing it correctly, the current behavior could leave multiple repositories in the cherry-picking state, and the user would have to manually run \"git -C \u003cpath\u003e cherry-pick --abort\" for all of them, which could be very inconvenient.\n\nIMO, it\u0027d be better to auto-abort all of them and just show the list of repositories where the cherry-picking failed. (but seems like this would require some non-trivial changes in this code)\n\nWhat do you think?",
