My hands were quite full with other projects and technically jiri is no longer maintained by toolchain team.\n\nKey() function is defined at https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/+/6fbf3e390ec99b6557340f55a6726bb74381ce95/project/manifest.go#550 , which is package local path and URL connected with a separator. So this change makes Jiri fail if it finds another package with the same package url and local path, regardless of the package revision.",
