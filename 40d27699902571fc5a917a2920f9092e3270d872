In general I prefer tools that have scriptable output, so when I ask for a list of things, they give me a list of paths, and when they find nothing, they output nothing. Output like to stderr is ok, but I generally prefer not.\n\nI realize that this may be somewhat of a convention for this tool at this point, and if so, then we should discuss this separately.",
