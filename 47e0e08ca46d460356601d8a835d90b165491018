      "message": "Just as a note, this test is too long and too complicated. We should probably break this into multiple tests (as in one TestXxx function per test case \u003d\u003d each test case should start by setting up the environment which includes the flags, which could be probably factored out into a common setup method). That should be done in a separate change though.",
