      "message": "Is this a commit ID in the jiri repo itself?  How do you plan to update this (since changing this generates a new commit, etc?)  Seems really annoying to require (at least) 2 commits per change to jiri we want to roll out.\n\nHow about segregating the version into its own repo that points to commits in jiri?",

      "message": "After talking to phosek about this, I think what we want is:\n\n1. a \"bootstrap\" version of jiri that either never or seldom changes -- bootstrap_jiri will fetch that version\n2. upload_jiri will upload git-sha-based versions of jiri prebuilts for use in #3\n3. after bootstrap, jiri will manage itself via tools and that will involve downloading prebuilts instead of building from source. the version information should be in either \u0027manifest\u0027 or a separate repo -- \u0027packages\u0027 comes to mind.",
