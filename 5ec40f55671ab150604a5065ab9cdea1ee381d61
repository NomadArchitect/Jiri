      "message": "One possible improvement is that we could expand BranchState struct to also include Revision and then use it for both CurrentBranch and TrackingBranch, so this will look something like:\n\ntype BranchState struct {\n  Name string\n  Revision string\n  ...\n}\n\ntype ProjectState struct {\n  Branches []BranchState\n  CurrentBranch BranchState\n  TrackingBranch BranchState\n  ...\n}\n\nHowever, this might require additional changes/cleanup around the codebase so feel free to do that in a separate change.",
