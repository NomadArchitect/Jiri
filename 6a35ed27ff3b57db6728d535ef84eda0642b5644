      "message": "hey nathan, \ni tested out the command; \n`git cat-file -t [string]` appears to accept any strings, not just HEAD but any branch names, which returns \"commit\" and same goes for tag names as well, annotated or not. \n\nthe more I look into various methods, the more I\u0027m leaning towards going with the \"dumb inefficient\" route to make it bulletproof. \n\nthough i am comfortable with git, i certainly am not familiar with the entire world of git and i am afraid that i may be missing another edge case(s), leaving a potential bug. plus, I think the perf loss is negligible.\n\nthoughts?",
