      "message": "I think we should also handle the error case when the subsequent operations fail and we would leave the workspace in an inconsistent state. We could set up a deferred call and try to move things back to previous state so a repeated Jiri invocations don\u0027t fail. That might also fail though so we might consider just printing instructions to user for how to recover their workspace manually.",
