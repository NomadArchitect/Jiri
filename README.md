# Jiri

*"Jiri integrates repositories intelligently"*

Jiri is a tool for multi-repo development.
It supports:
* syncing multiple local repos with upstream,
* capturing the current state of all local repos in a "snapshot",
* restoring local project state from a snapshot, and
* facilitating sending change lists to [Gerrit][gerrit].

Jiri has an extensible plugin model, making it easy to create new sub-commands.

Jiri is open-source.  See the contributor guidelines [here][contributing].

## Jiri Basics
Jiri organizes a set of repositories on your local filesystem according to a
[manifest][manifests].  These repositories are referred to as "projects", and
are all contained within a single directory called the "jiri root" which is
assumed to be set in the `JIRI_ROOT` environment variable.

The manifest file specifies the relative location of each project within the
jiri root, and also includes other metadata about the project such as its
remote url, the remote branch it should track, and more.

The `jiri update` command syncs the master branch of all local projects to the
revision and remote branch specified in the manifest for each project.  Jiri
will create the project locally if it does not exist, and if run with the `-gc`
flag, jiri will "garbage collect" any projects that are not listed in the
manifest by deleting them locally.

The `.jiri_manifest` file in the jiri root describes which project jiri should
sync.  Typically the `.jiri_manifest` file will import other manifests, but it
can also contain a list of projects.

For example, here is a simple `.jiri_manifest` with just two projects, "foo"
and "bar", which are hosted on github and bitbucket respectively.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <projects>
    <project name="foo-project"
             remote="https://github.com/my-org/foo"
             path="foo"/>
    <project name="bar"
             remote="https://bitbucket.com/other-org/bar"
             path="bar"/>
  </projects>
</manifest>
```
When you run `jiri update` for the first time, the "foo" and "bar" repos will
be cloned into `$JIRI_ROOT/foo` and `$JIRI_ROOT/bar` respectively.  Running
`jiri update` again will sync the master branch of these repos with the remote
master branch.

Note that the project paths do not need to be immediate children of the jiri
root.  We could have decided to set the `path` attribute for the "bar" project
to "third_party/bar", or even nest "bar" inside the "foo" project by setting
the `path` to  "foo/bar" (assuming no files in the foo repo conflict with bar).

Because manifest files also need to be kept in sync between various team
members, it often makes sense to keep your team's manifests in a version
controlled repository.

Jiri makes it easy to "import" a remote manifest from your local
`.jiri_manifest` file with the `jiri import` command.  For example, running the
following command will create a `.jiri_manifest` file (or append to an existing
one) with an `import` tag that imports the minimal manifest from the
`https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/manifest` repo.

```
jiri import minimal https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/manifest
```

The next time you run `jiri update`, jiri will sync all projects listed in the
minimal manifest.

## Quickstart

This section explains how to get started with jiri.

First we "bootstrap" jiri so that it can sync and build itself.

Then we create and import a new manifest, which specifies how jiri should
manage your projects.

### Bootstrapping

You can get jiri up-and-running in no time with the help of the [bootstrap
script][bootstrap_jiri].

First, pick a jiri root directory.  All projects will be synced to
subdirectories of the root.

```
export MY_ROOT=$HOME/myroot
```

Execute the `jiri_bootstrap` script, which will fetch and build the jiri tool,
and initialize the root directory.

```
curl -s
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuchsia-mirror/jiri/master/scripts/bootstrap_jiri | bash -s "$MY_ROOT"
```

The `jiri` command line tool will be installed in
`$MY_ROOT/.jiri_root/scripts/jiri`, so add that to your `PATH`.

```
export PATH="$MY_ROOT"/.jiri_root/scripts:$PATH
```

Next, use the `jiri import` command to import the "minimal" manifest from the
Fuchsia repo.  This manifest includes only the projects needed to
build the Jiri itself.

You can see the minimal manifest [here][minimal manifest].  For more
information on manifests, read the [manifest docs][manifests].

```
cd "$MY_ROOT"
jiri import minimal https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/manifest
```

You should now have a file in the root directory called `.jiri_manifest`, which
will contain a single import.

Finally, run `jiri update`, which will sync all local projects to the revisions
listed in the manifest (which in this case will be `HEAD`).


```
jiri update
```

You should now see the jiri project in
`$MY_ROOT/src/fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri`.

Running `jiri update` again will sync the local repos to the remotes, and
rebuild the jiri tool.

### Managing your projects with jiri

Now that jiri is able to sync and build itself, we must tell it how to manage
your projects.

In order for jiri to manage a set of projects, those projects must be listed in
a [manifest][manifests], and that manifest must be hosted in a git repo.

If you already have a manifest hosted in a git repo, you can import that
manifest the same way we imported the "minimal" manifest.

For example, if your manifest is called "my_manifest" and is in a repo hosted
at "https://github.com/my_org/manifests", then you can import that manifest
as follows.

```
jiri import my_manifest https://github.com/my_org/manifests
```

The rest of this section walks through how to create a manifest from scratch,
host it from a local git repo, and get jiri to manage it.

Suppose that the project you want jiri to manage is the "Hello-World" repo
located at https://github.com/Test-Octowin/Hello-World.

First we'll create a new git repo to host the manifest we'll be writing.

```
mkdir -p /tmp/my_manifest_repo
cd /tmp/my_manifest_repo
git init
```

Next we'll create a manifest and commit it to the manifest repo.

The manifest file will include the Hello-World repo as well as the manifest
repo itself.

```
cat <<EOF > my_manifest
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <projects>
    <project name="Hello-World"
             remote="https://github.com/Test-Octowin/Hello-World"
             path="helloworld"/>
    <project name="manifest"
             remote="/tmp/my_manifest_repo"
             path="manifest"/>
  </projects>
</manifest>
EOF

git add my_manifest
git commit -m "Add my_manifest."
```

This manifest contains a single project with the name "Hello-World" and the
remote of the repo.  The `path` attribute tells jiri to sync this repo inside
the `helloworld` directory.

Normally we would want to push this repo to some remote to make it accessible
to other users who want to sync the same projects.  For now, however, we'll
just refer to the repo by its path in the local filesystem.

Now we just need to import that new manifest and `jiri update`.  Since we don't
want the new manifest repo to conflict with the minimal manifest repo, we must
pass the `-path` flag to the import statement.

```
cd "$MY_ROOT"
jiri import -path="my_manifest_repo" my_manifest /tmp/my_manifest_repo
jiri update
```

You should now see the Hello-World repo in `$MY_ROOT/helloworld`, and your
manifest repo in `$MY_ROOT/my_manifest_repo`.

## Command-line help

The `jiri help` command will print help documentation about the `jiri` tool and
its subcommands.

For general documentation, including a list of subcommands, run `jiri help`.
To find documentation about a specific topic or subcommand, run `jiri help
<command>`.

You can read all the command-line documentation in a single page here:

## Gerrit CL workflow

[Gerrit][gerrit] is a collaborative code-review tool used by many open source
projects.

One of the peculiarities of Gerrit is that it expects a changelist to be
represented by a single commit.  This constrains the way developers may use git
to work on their changes.  In particular, they must use the --amend flag with
all but the first git commit operation and they need to use git rebase to sync
their pending code change with the remote master.  See Android's [repo command
reference][android repo] or Go's [contributing instructions][go contrib] for
examples of how intricate the workflow for resolving conflicts between the
pending code change and the remote master is.

The `jiri cl` command enables interaction with Gerrit without having to use
such a complex and error-prone workflow.  With `jiri cl`, users commit as often
as they want on feature branches, and `jiri cl` handles the hard work of
squashing all commits into a single commit and sending to Gerrit.

The rest of this section describes common development operations using `jiri
cl`.  The term "CL" (short for "ChangeList") refers to a set of code changes
uploaded for review.

### Using feature branches

The "master" branch of each local repository is reserved for tracking its
remote counterpart.  All development should take place on a non-master
"feature" branch.  Once the code is reviewed and approved, it is merged into
the remote master via the Gerrit code review system.  The change can then be
merged into the local master branch with `jiri update`.

<!-- TODO(nlacasse): dje is changing this behavior.  The plan is that "master"
will be the default reserved branch for each repo, but that can be overridden
with the `localbranch` attribute in the manifest.  Update this section once
this change lands. -->

### Creating a new CL

1. Sync the master branch with the remote.
  ```
  jiri update
  ```
2. Create a new feature branch for the CL.
  ```
  jiri cl new <branch-name>
  ```
3. Make modifications to the project source code.
4. Stage any changed files for commit.
  ```
  git add <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>
  ```
5. Commit the changes.
  ```
  git commit
  ```
6. Repeat steps 3-5 as necessary.

### Syncing a CL with the remote

1. Sync the master branch with the remote.
  ```
  jiri update
  ```
2. Switch to the feature branch that corresponds to the CL under development.
  ```
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
3. Sync the feature branch with the master branch.
  ```
  jiri cl sync
  ```
4. If there are no conflicts between the master and the feature branch, the CL
   has been successfully synced with the remote.
5. If there are conflicts:
  1. Manually [resolve the conflicts][github resolve conflict].
  2. Stage any changed files for a commit.
    ```
    git add <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>
    ```
  3. Commit the changes.
    ```
    git commit
    ```

### Requesting a code review

1. Switch to the feature branch that corresponds to the CL under development.
  ```
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
2.  Upload the CL to Gerrit.
  ```
  jiri cl upload
  ```

If the CL upload is  successful, this will print the URL of the CL hosted on
Gerrit.  You can add reviewers and comments through the [Gerrit web UI][gerrit
web ui] at that URL.

Note that there are many useful flags for `jiri cl`.  You can learn about them
by running `jiri cl --help`.

### Reviewing a CL

1. Follow the link received in the code review email request.
2. Use the [Gerrit web UI][gerrit web UI] to comment on the CL and click the
   "Reply" button to submit comments, selecting the appropriate code-review
   score.

### Addressing review comments


1. Switch to the feature branch that corresponds to the CL under development.
  ```
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```
2. Modify and commit the code as described above.
3. Reply to each Gerrit comment and click the "Reply" button to send them.
4. Send the updated CL to Gerrit.
  ```
  jiri cl upload
  ```

### Submitting a CL
1. Note that if the CL conflicts with any changes that have been submitted
   since the last update of the CL, these conflicts need to be resolved before
   the CL can be submitted.  To do so, follow the steps in the "Syncing a CL
   with the remote" section above and then upload the updated CL to Gerrit.
  ```
  jiri cl upload
  ```
2. Once a CL meets the conditions for being submitted, it can be merged into
   the remote master branch by clicking the "Submit" button on the Gerrit web
   UI.
3. Delete the local feature branch after the CL has been submitted to Gerrit.
  1. Sync the master branch to the laster version of the remote.
    ```
    jiri update
    ```
  2. Safely delete the feature branch that corresponds to the CL.
    ```
    jiri cl cleanup <branch-name>
    ```

Note that deleting the feature branch with `git branch -d <branch-name>` won't
work in general because the git history on the local feature branch differs
from the history on the remote master.  The local feature branch might have
many small commits, while the remote will have the same changes squashed into a
single commit.  This difference in the history will prevent git from letting
you do `git branch -d <branch-name>`.  You *can* use `git branch -D
<branch-name>`, but that can potentially cause you to lose work if the branch
has not been merged into master yet.  For this reason, we recommend using `jiri
cl cleanup` to delete the feature branch safely.

### Dependent CLs
If you have changes A and B, and B depends on A, you can still submit distinct
CLs for A and B that can be reviewed and submitted independently (although A
must be submitted before B).

First, create your feature branch for A, make your change, and upload the CL
for review according to the instructions above.

Then, while still on the feature branch for A, create your feature branch for B.
```
jiri cl new feature-B
```
Then make your change and upload the CL for review according to the
instructions above.

You can respond to review comments by submitting new patch sets as normal.

After the CL for A has been submitted, make sure to clean up A's feature branch
and upload a new patch set for feature B.
```
jiri update # fetch update that includes feature A
git checkout feature-B
jiri cl cleanup feature-A
git merge master # merge feature A into feature B branch
jiri cl upload # send new patch set for feature B
```
The CL for feature B can now be submitted.

This process can be extended for more than 2 CLs.  You must keep two things in mind:
* always create the dependent feature branch with `jiri cl new` from the parent feature branch, and
* after a parent feature has been submitted, cleanup the parent feature branch with `jiri cl cleanup`, and merge master into all dependent CLs and upload new patch sets.

## FAQ

### Why the name "jiri"?
[Jiří][jiri-wiki] is a very popular boys name in the Czech Republic.

### How do you pronounce "jiri"?
We pronounce "jiri" like "yiree".

The actual Czech name [Jiří][jiri-wiki] is pronounced something like "yirzhee".

### Why can't I commit to my master branch?

Jiri keeps the master branch of each project in the state described in the
manifest.  Any changes that are made to the master branch would be lost during
the next `jiri update`.

<!-- TODO(nlacasse): Answer these.
### Why not repo/gclient/etc?
### How can I test changes to a manifest without pushing it upstream?
