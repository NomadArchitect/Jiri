      "message": "IMO I\u0027d expect there to be a -dry-run option that prints out what\u0027ll be deleted without actually doing anything, so the current default behavior would be equivalent to calling `jiri branch -delete -dry-run` while calling `jiri branch -delete` would actually delete stuff. It\u0027s how most tools work, so if you\u0027re doing something else, you\u0027re violating POLA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) which is not necessarily wrong, but you should have a really good reason for doing so.",

      "message": "the reason was that this is a destructive operation, across hundreds of repos which cannot be reverted easily. \n\nAlso what would jiri return if jiri branch is used without -D and -dry-run? \n\nThis command was only suppose to delete branches and not do anything else hence the name. If i rename it to jiri branch then user will expect other things from it as well which I think would again violate POLA",
