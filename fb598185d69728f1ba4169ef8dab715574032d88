      "message": "+cc: nmulcahey@ for additional thoughts.\n\nIf jiri sets up the git project the hooks directory should exist. When you say boostrap protobuf, what do you mean? Is it being pulled from a remote? If so, adding it to the manifest and then doing an local jiri update should create the git folder.\n\nCan you upload the CL that is giving you trouble w/ jiri update somewhere and I can try to reproduce locally?",
