# This script uploads jiri binaries to Google storage, therefore it expects to
# be run in an environment with the credentials necessary for uploading to
# gs://fuchsia-build.  The binaries stored in a convention which matches the
# expectations of bootstrap_jiri.

# There's a fundamental disagreement between the way Fuchsia organizes its
# repos and the way Go wants to organize code: Fuchsia has a /jiri repo that
# contains all the code, Go wants the code to live in a directory structure
# that reflects the import paths (i.e. fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/...).
#
# To deal with that, and to keep your environment tidy, this script creates a
# temporary directory and checks out a fresh copy of jiri into that structure.
# This has the notable side-effect of only being able to upload jiri binaries
# from source that's actually checked in.
